# CoreComm – AI Voice Agent Platform for Customer Support

## Concept Summary

CoreComm is an AI-powered, voice-first customer support solution that enables companies to handle incoming phone calls with a conversational AI agent capable of understanding natural speech, responding in real time, and performing actions through MCP server integrations. CoreComm combines telephony infrastructure, speech recognition, conversational AI, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and action execution to deliver accurate, context-aware, and human-like phone support.

## How It Works

### Call Connection

1. Customer dials the company's dedicated support number.
2. Call is routed through a VoIP/SIP gateway (e.g., Twilio, Vonage, SignalWire) into CoreComm's voice processing pipeline.

### Speech-to-Text (STT)

1. Customer speech is transcribed in real-time using streaming ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) models (e.g., OpenAI Realtime API, Deepgram, Google Cloud STT).
2. Punctuation, speaker diarization, and confidence scoring are applied.

### Conversational AI Orchestration

Transcribed text is sent to the CoreComm AI Engine:

- **Query Understanding & Context Enrichment**: Detect intent, identify relevant customer/account data.
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Use RAG to pull information from:
  - Company knowledge base
  - CRM/ticket history
  - Product manuals
  - FAQ documents
- **Action Execution**: If the request involves a task (e.g., checking order status, booking an appointment), CoreComm sends an MCP request to the relevant server.

### Text-to-Speech (TTS)

1. AI responses are converted into realistic, low-latency speech using neural TTS engines (e.g., ElevenLabs, Azure Neural Voice, OpenAI Realtime).
2. The voice can be customized for brand tone (friendly, formal, etc.).

### MCP Integration

CoreComm uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) to securely request:

- Real-time account lookups
- Service status checks
- Order updates
- Custom workflows (e.g., open a ticket, update subscription)

MCP servers return structured responses for CoreComm to present to the caller.

### Escalation to Human Agent

1. If the AI cannot resolve the issue or confidence is low, the call can be warm-transferred to a live support agent.
2. The transcript, retrieved context, and customer info are passed to the agent for continuity.

## Core Technical Architecture

### Telephony Layer
- SIP/VoIP integration via Twilio/Vonage/SIP trunk.

### Real-Time STT/TTS Layer
- **STT**: Deepgram Streaming API / Google Speech-to-Text / OpenAI Realtime ASR
- **TTS**: ElevenLabs / Azure Neural Voice / OpenAI Realtime TTS

### CoreComm AI Engine
- **Intent Recognition**: LLM-based intent parsing
- **RAG Pipeline**: Embeddings + vector search for knowledge grounding
- **LLM Orchestration**: GPT-4, Claude, or equivalent, with retrieval context
- **MCP Client**: Secure integration with MCP servers for action execution

### Integration Layer
- CRM connectors
- Helpdesk software
- Custom MCP endpoints

### Escalation System
- Real-time agent handoff
- Context pass-through

## Key Features

- **Natural Conversational Experience**: Human-like, real-time voice interaction.
- **Knowledge Grounding**: Always answers from verified sources.
- **Actionable Conversations**: Execute customer requests through MCP servers.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Handle calls in multiple languages.
- **Custom Voice Personas**: Maintain brand identity in audio responses.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Monitor calls, resolution rates, and escalation triggers.
- **Continuous Learning**: Improve accuracy from feedback loops.

## Example Use Cases

- **Telecom Support**: Check data usage, reset password, troubleshoot devices.
- **E-commerce**: Track orders, initiate returns, recommend products.
- **Banking**: Check account balance, freeze card, report fraud.
- **Healthcare**: Schedule appointments, provide medication reminders.

## Example Call Flow

**Customer**: "Hi, I want to check the status of my last order."

**CoreComm AI**: Retrieves order history via MCP integration with CRM → "Sure, I see your last order was placed on August 5th and is currently out for delivery. Would you like me to send you the tracking link?"

**Customer**: "Yes, please."

**CoreComm AI**: Triggers MCP workflow to send SMS → "Done. I've sent the tracking link to your phone number ending in 4321."

## Benefits

- 24/7 availability without extra staffing.
- Faster resolution time for routine queries.
- Reduced wait times and call queue lengths.
- Actionable, integrated support instead of just answering FAQs.
- Seamless escalation to human agents for complex cases.
